# Paragraph One

Here is a paragraph in R markdown. It is a chunk of text with no preceding marks or symbols. A paragraph usually has 3-4 sentences, so here is the last one. some citations could include papers we read in this class [@McGill2010; @Carpenter1996; @Srivastava2004].

## Including Plots

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(cars)
setwd("C:/Users/Zebadiah/OneDrive/NDSU/advanced_ecology")
(histo <- ggplot(cars, aes(x=dist))+
					  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5))
```
